    "\n",
    "1. **Welfare and growth systematically fall as GBM is reduced.** So the final calibration delivers a welfare gain of 4.6 percent. (1/3) of our baseline value. Much of this is because growth is not changing as much now aoubt 10 basis points. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The only parameter changing across calibrations is Chi. Surprisingly, the trade costs, theta, and exporter fixed costs are virtually unchanged through out the excercise. This suggests strongly about how trade and the exporter facts basically pin down d, theta, kappa. Then the growth rate is all about chi.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Change in trade. This is not a mechanichal function of theta and the counterfactuall. It is changing a bit, but not always 3.29. I think this is because the trade elasticity is always a PE elasticit, hold prices fixed, change tau by a small amount, the trade changes by theta. We are not in this world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using logic from the non-GBM case, the issue seems to be about how Chi is feeding into the elasticity of growth. What we are finding is that as we decrease GBM variance, that Chi is increasing (about 0.20 in baseline, 0.50 in low GBM situation), this means that the adoption cost is ???\n",
