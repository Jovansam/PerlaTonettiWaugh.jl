First, calibrating the model with a different normalization results in identical parameter values for all parameters except κ. In the theoretical analysis, equations (33) and (35) show that ζ only appears in the form ζ/κ. Thus, a different choice of ζ results in a different κ to match the g and λii moments.\n",

However, as equation (53) shows, any combination of ζ and κ results in the same welfare gains from trade as long as λii and all other parameter values are equal. It is in this sense that ζ = 1 is a normalization. Numerical analysis of the quantitative model confirms these observations both for steady-state comparative statics\n",
